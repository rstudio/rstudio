# This file is intentionally left empty. All calls to this bundle will
# be delegated to the parent bundle ValidationMessages (which contains 
# English messages).
#
# Not providing this bundle would cause the bundle for the default 
# locale to take precedence over the base bundle. If the default locale 
# is not English but one, for which a resource bundle exists (e.g. German),
# the English texts would never be returned.
