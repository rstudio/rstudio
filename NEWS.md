## RStudio 2025.04.0 "Mariposa Orchid" Release Notes

### New
#### RStudio
- On macOS, RStudio now uses the project directory / home directory for new RStudio sessions opened via the Dock menu's "Open in New Window" command. (#15409)
- RStudio installation on Windows now registers icons for many supported file types. (#12730)
- RStudio for Windows binaries now have digital signatures. (rstudio-pro#5772)
- RStudio now only writes the ProjectId field within a project's `.Rproj` file when required. Currently, this is for users who have configured a custom `.Rproj.user` location.
- RStudio will now preserve unknown fields in `.Rproj` files that are added by future versions of RStudio. (#15524)
- RStudio now sends an interrupt git processes when stopped via "Stop" during a git commit, rather than just terminating the processes. (#6471)

#### Posit Workbench
- An SELinux policy module is now available, allowing Workbench to run when enforcement is enabled. (#4937, rstudio-pro/#4749)
