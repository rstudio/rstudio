## TODO

executing python line-by-line w/ an Rmd open in visual mode doesn't work
(because we've disabled that command -- does it not call manageCommands?)


Look into Joe's review of the scoped actions handler

Implement shortcode handling (https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)
  - Pattern matching based mark detector for just the standard and close variations (standalone marks)
  - WriteRawMarkdown for < > delimiters (but leave inside along)
  - Command in UI that inserts an inline shortcode
  - mark detector / deleter
  - Consider shortcode blocks? (regognize by single-line begin then scan to end)

Link popups no longer truncated (see advanced_ui.Rmd)

Positioning of ellipses in props button
Button ellipses shouldn't require positioning override
(see EditorPane.module.scss)

Alison on blogdown engines, etc.

Bookdown & Blogdown docs:
  - Math in code
  - @ref has no \
  - Heading parts (need to explicitly use .unnumbered and don't use the \* escape)
  - Using blackfriday explicitly
  - Setting the doctype(s) explicitly (should xref be a doctype or should it be distill)

MathJax preview. When containing the selection, the math will show both the code and the preview. When not containing the selection will show the preview. (so probably require a node view for this). Consider a “done” gesture for display math. May need to bring back
escaping of $ in math as this mode will clearly not be "source mode" style latex equation editing

Possibly have a special editing mode for thereoms?


## Future


Google Docs style list toggling

Slack style handling of marks?

Reveal codes / typora behavior

Unit testing for core panmirror code

Insert special character UX

Deleting withProgress in TextEditingTargetVisualMode breaks everything! (see inline comment)


multimarkdown support is incomplete: -mmd\_title\_block -mmd\_link\_attributes (not written, likely limitation of pandoc) -mmd\_header\_identifiers (work fine, but we currently allow edit of classes + keyvalue for markdown\_mmd)

no support for +pandoc\_title\_block

Example lists don't round trip through the AST:
  - (@good) referenced elsewhere via (@good) just becomes a generic example (@) with a literal numeric reference.
  - The writer doesn't preserve the (@) or the (@good) when writing

We currently can't round-trip reference links (as pandoc doesn't seem to write them, this is not disimillar from the situation w/ inline footnotes so may be fine)

allow more control over markdown output, particularly list indenting (perhaps get a PR into pandoc to make it flexible)

as with above, make character escaping configurable

No editing support for fancy list auto-numbering (\#. as list item that is auto-numbered)

Consider special Knit behavior from Visual Mode: execute w/ keep_md and only re-executes R code when the code chunks have actually changed.

## Known issues:

- When dragging and dropping an image to a place in the document above the original position the shelf sometimes
  stays in it's original position (until you scroll)

- Tables with a large number of columns are written as HTML when variable column widths are presented 
  (presumably b/c it can't represent the percentage  granularity w/ markdown) Perhaps don't set widths 
  on all of the columns (only ones explicitly sized?). Or, detect when this occurs by examining the doc before
  and markdown after transformation and automatically adjust the value?

- Clear Formatting doesn't play well with table selections (only one of the cells is considered part of the "selected nodes")

- Semicolons in citations cannot be escaped (they always indicate a delimiter). Solution to this would be
  to mark them explicitly with an input rule (and color them so user sees that there is a state change).

- Edit attributes button is incorrectly positioned in note (this is due to the additional dom elements created by the node view)
  Note however that headings and divs seem to be poorly supported in notes anyway.

## Project/Build

Can we minify the typescript library?

<https://fuse-box.org/docs/getting-started/typescript-project>

Can we combine the editor library w/ the prosemirror/orderedmap dependencies? <https://github.com/fathyb/parcel-plugin-typescript>
