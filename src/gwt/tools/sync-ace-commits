# This script is used to automate combining an upstream version of Ace
# with the patches that we maintain.
#
# If you need to run this script, some prerequisites are required.
# - Install Node.js and npm
# - Run tools/sync-ace-commit (it will fail)
# - Go to tools/ace/support/dryice and run "npm link ."
#
# To sync to a more recent commit of Ace:
# - Clone git@github.com:rstudio/ace.git
# - From that repo, configure an upstream remote:
#     git remote add upstream git@github.com:ajaxorg/ace.git
# == The above steps just need to be performed once, not every time ==
# - `git fetch upstream`
# - `git checkout master`       # make sure you're on the master branch
# - `git reset --hard upstream/master` # go to latest commit
# - `git push origin master`    # put the latest into GitHub
# - `git rev-parse HEAD`        # this is the latest commit SHA-1
# - Paste the SHA-1 from the previous command into the line below that
#   begins "git reset --hard"
# - Run sync-ace-commit
#
# As upstream Ace evolves, inevitably they introduce changes that conflict
# with the patches we maintain. To resolve these conflicts, go to the rep
# you created in the previous set of instructions, and:
# - `git checkout <SHA-1>`      # Go to the upstream commit
# - `git merge <bugfix-branch>` # Try merging
# - If previous step SUCCEEDS, start at the top but try the next branch.
# - If the merge FAILS:
# - `git merge --abort`
# - `git checkout -b <new-bugfix-branch>` # I use the old name plus a number
# - `git merge <bugfix-branch>`
# - Resolve the merge conflict as you usually would, and commit
# - Update this sync-ace-commits script to refer to the new bugfix branch
# - Repeat all of these steps if you still get merge conflicts
