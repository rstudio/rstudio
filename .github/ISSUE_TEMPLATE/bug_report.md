This issue tracker is for bugs and feature requests in the RStudio IDE. If you're having trouble with R itself or an R package, see https://www.r-project.org/help.html, and if you want to ask a question rather than report a bug, go to https://community.rstudio.com/. Finally, if you use RStudio Server Pro, get in touch with our Pro support team at support@rstudio.com.
