### Upgrade Instructions

#### Posit Workbench

With this release, Positron Pro sessions are moving from preview to General Availability (GA). The upgrade process will automatically back up any existing Positron Pro configuration files to ensure production-ready defaults are properly installed.

During package upgrade, the following files will be backed up if they exist:

- `/etc/rstudio/positron.conf` as `/etc/rstudio/positron.conf.bak`
- `/etc/rstudio/positron-user-settings.conf` as `/etc/rstudio/positron-user-settings.conf.bak`

After completing the package upgrade, carefully review the backed up files and the new default configuration files and merge any customizations as needed.
