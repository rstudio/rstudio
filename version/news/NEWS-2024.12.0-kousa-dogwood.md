#### Posit Workbench

- Posit Workbench Administration Guide, Posit Workbench User Guide, and Posit Workbench Licenses guide now include versioned URLs in the Guides drop-down menu in the navigation bar (rstudio-pro#6151)
- Posit Workbench User Guide underwent a reorganization of how the individual IDE guides are presented. Each guide was migrated from the left-hand navigation to the upper (main) navigation bar. Now, when a guide is selected from the navigation bar, only that guide's contents display in the left-hand navigation. Additionally, the Posit Workbench guide was renamed to "Workbench Setup" in the navigation bar to prevent confusion between the title of the guide and to create more distinction between the home page of the guide and the Posit Workbench Overview. Lastly, the links for the four IDEs were updated to navigate to the corresponding guide within the Posit Workbench User Guide (instead of the IDE's external site) and are displayed as buttons (rstudio-pro#6069)
- Restrict Positron and VS Code sessions for insecure (non-SSL) contexts. These editors do not work properly otherwise. (rstudio-pro#3741)
- Added support for HTTP Proxy variables in rserver and rsession to enable managed credentials features in Workbench environments behind a proxy server. (rstudio-pro#5893)
- Set Public Package Manager (P3M) as the default for R libraries in RStudio Pro sessions, if no other repository is specified. Package Manager will deliver pre-built binary packages when available, which are faster to install than source packages and don't require most additional build dependencies. (rstudio-pro#5066)
- Added support for registering shell scripts as session hooks which can run when a session starts and stops. (rstudio-pro#6428)
- Extended the workbench API adding support for launching jobs, resuming sessions, and retrieving user lists. Additionally support for passing in environment variables, session hooks, and a file to open on session load has been added to the launch session endpoint. (rstudio-pro#5066)
- Added a `session-timeout-kill-hours` setting to VS Code and Positron sessions to be terminated after being idle for a set number of hours. (rstudio-pro#5746)
- Added a countdown on the homepage for VS Code and Positron sessions to reflect the `session-timeout-kill-hours` setting and indicate when a session may be terminated if the user doesn't interact with it (rstudio-pro#6743)
- The most recently opened folder is saved for Positron sessions (rstudio-pro#6874)
- Added preview support for setting an active timeout, which logs out users after a period of time, regardless of activity. (rstudio-pro#5815)

HTTP Proxy variables are now supported in rserver and rsession, so it is important to include local addresses to Job Launcher sessions and other internal services in your `NO_PROXY` list. See the [Outgoing Proxies](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/access_and_security/outgoing_proxies.html) section of the Workbench Admin Guide for more information. (rstudio-pro#5893)

See the [Publishing Jupyter Notebooks to Connect](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/integration/jupyter-multiple-python-versions.html#publishing-jupyter-notebooks-to-connect) section of the Posit Workbench Administration Guide for more information(rstudio-pro#6989)
