Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications 
(including R). These applications include:

R:         http://www.r-project.org/ 
CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/ (choose "Add to system path" during install)
Java:      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
Ant:       http://code.google.com/p/winant
NSIS:      http://nsis.sourceforge.net

Installing QT
=============================================================================

Qt installation involves both the Qt SDK and MinGW compiler
as well as version Qt 4.8.3 of the Qt Framework. First, install
the QtSDK from this URL:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/QtSdk-online-win-x86-v1_2_1.exe

Note that Mingw 4.4 and the MinGW version of Qt are not installed
by default so you need to perform a custom installation and 
modify the following defaults:

- Under Development Tools, select the MinGW variant of the Qt
framework (the last of the variants listed)
- Under Miscellaneous, specify that Mingw4.4 be installed

RStudio is built against version 4.8.3 of the Qt Framework, so you should
install it from here:

http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.3/qt-win-opensource-4.8.3-mingw.exe


Update System Path
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires that the CMake, Qt, and MingGW executables be 
accessible via the system path (note that CMake should already be accessible
via the CMake installer if the "Add to system path" option was chosen during
installation). For Qt and MinGW you should ensure that the following 
additional directories are available on the path:

C:\Qt\4.8.3\bin
C:\QtSDK\mingw\bin

Finally, you should also ensure that your R installation's bin
directory is on the system path. For example:

C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.1\bin\i386


Satisfy Additional Dependencies
=============================================================================

Additional dependencies (boost, mingw64, GWT, and gin) can be satisfied by
running the following script:

install-dependencies.cmd
