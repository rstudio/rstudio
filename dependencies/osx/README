(including R). These applications include:

- R:         https://www.r-project.org/
- XCode:     https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
- CMake:     https://www.cmake.org/

Note that after installing XCode you should also be sure to install the XCode
Command Line Tools (which can be done by running the following:

xcode-select --install
