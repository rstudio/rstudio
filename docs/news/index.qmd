#### Posit Workbench
- Added preview support for Positron Pro sessions on RHEL9 and Ubuntu 22/24. Positron Pro sessions must be manually configured by an admin. (rstudio-pro#6861)
- Added support for saving Positron Pro state across user logout. (rstudio-pro#6820)
- Added a feature that prevents Positron Pro and VS Code sessions from starting for insecure (non-SSL/TLS) contexts because they require SSL/TLS for full functionality. (rstudio-pro#3741)
- Added a `session-timeout-kill-hours` setting to VS Code and Positron Pro sessions, which terminates sessions after being idle for a set number of hours. There is a known issue that prevents this feature from working correctly with a custom www-root-path. (rstudio-pro#5746)
- Added the Quarto, Posit Shiny, and Posit Publisher extensions to the default `vscode.extensions.conf` file for fresh installs. These extensions will be installed automatically for users upon VS Code session launch. (rstudio-pro#6388)
- Added preview support for setting an active timeout, which logs out users after a period of time, regardless of activity. (rstudio-pro#5815)
- Added a new session init container that copies session components to the session container, allowing updates to components independent of the session image. The session init container can be enabled in Kubernetes sessions by setting `launcher-sessions-auto-update=1` in `rserver.conf`. Additionally, the init container uses a new multi-platform Linux session components package to support session images across different Linux distributions. (rstudio-pro#6821)
- Added the `auth-user-rewrite-rule` setting to `rserver.conf`. When this option is set in environments with Google OAuth, OpenID, SAML, or Proxied Authentication configured, Workbench will rewrite the username from the authentication provider using the provided regex. (rstudio-pro#2502)
- Added support for HTTP Proxy variables in rserver and rsession to enable managed credentials features in Workbench environments behind a proxy server. (rstudio-pro#5893)
- Set Posit Public Package Manager (P3M) as the default for R libraries in RStudio Pro sessions, if no other repository is specified. Package Manager will deliver pre-built binary packages when available, which are faster to install than source packages and don't require most additional build dependencies. (rstudio-pro#5066)
- Added support to the Workbench API for registering shell scripts as session hooks that can run when a session starts and stops. (rstudio-pro#6428)
- Extended the Workbench API, adding support for launching jobs, resuming sessions, and retrieving user lists. Additionally, support for passing in environment variables, session hooks, and a file to open on session load has been added to the launch session endpoint. (rstudio-pro#5066)
- The Posit Workbench Administration Guide, the Posit Workbench User Guide, and the Posit Workbench Licenses Guide have versioned URLs in the Guides drop-down menu in the navigation bar. (rstudio-pro#6151)
- The Posit Workbench User Guide underwent a reorganization of how the individual IDE guides are presented. Each guide was migrated from the left-hand navigation to the upper (main) navigation bar. Now, when a guide is selected from the navigation bar, only that guide's contents display in the left-hand navigation. Additionally, the Posit Workbench guide was renamed to "Workbench Setup" in the navigation bar to prevent confusion between the title of the guide and to create more distinction between the home page of the guide and the Posit Workbench Overview. Lastly, the links for the five IDEs were updated to navigate to the corresponding guide within the Posit Workbench User Guide (instead of the IDE's external site) and are displayed as buttons. (rstudio-pro#6069)
- Added an FAQ page to the Reference Architectures section of the Posit Workbench Administration Guide. (rstudio-pro#6645)
- Re-designed the user experience for configuring managed credentials (rstudio-pro#6748)
- Added support for using Azure delegated credentials to access DevOps repositories (rstudio-pro#6734)
- Improved the database migration experience with additional feedback to the admin, logging, and potential error handling (rstudio-pro#6674)
- Increased default values for `rsession-proxy-max-wait-secs` and `www-thread-pool-size` (rstudio-pro#6149)
- Improved diagnostics for the license manager (rstudio-pro#5932)
- Added support for reloading the Launcher through systemd (rstudio-pro#3749)
- Added support for a configurable auth (SAML/OpenID) username re-write rule (rstudio-pro#6987)

- RStudio now supports Electron flags set via `~/.config/rstudio/electron-flags.conf` or `~/.config/electron-flags.conf` on Linux / macOS. On Windows, the paths are `%LocalAppData%\RStudio\electron-flags.conf` and `%LocalAppData%\electron-flags.conf`. (#14641)
- RStudio now uses a glimpse-like display for data.frame list-column entries. (#14257)

#### Posit Workbench

- Quitting Jupyter and VS Code sessions from the home page no longer force quits them immediately; instead, they are given time to exit gracefully, as with RStudio Pro sessions. (rstudio-pro#5317)

- Fixed an issue where code execution could pause in RStudio Server after closing the browser tab even with active computations. (Pro #3943)
- Chunk output calls `format()` method on vctrs-based classes stored in a dataframe. (#6878)
  
Python

- RStudio attempts to infer the appropriate version of Python when "Automatically activate project-local Python environments" is checked and the user has not requested a specific version of Python. This Python will be stored in the environment variable "RETICULATE_PYTHON_FALLBACK", available from the R console, the Python REPL, and the RStudio Terminal (#9990)
- Shiny for Python apps now display a "Run App" button on the Source editor toolbar. (Requires `shiny` Python package v0.2.7 or later.)

Quarto

- Support for v2 format of Quarto crossref index
- Support for RHEL7 and CentOS7 and fixes missing Pandoc for RMarkdown (rstudio-pro#3804)

Posit Workbench

- Rebranded Workbench from RStudio Workbench to Posit Workbench to match Posit Software, PBC's new branding terminology and iconography
- Adds `-l` (long) option to `rserver-url`. When `/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver-url -l <port number>` is executed within a VS Code or Jupyter session, the full URL where a user can view a server proxied at that port is displayed (rstudio-pro#3620)
- Support `launcher-local-proxy` load balancing option to ensure that session requests are always proxied from the local workbench server in a cluster. Eliminates the need to open a range of ports in the firewall for sessions to be reached by other workbench servers (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3670)
- Redesigned the session launch dialog from the homepage to show all session types at once (rstudio-pro#3646)
- Enabled the Job Launcher with the Local Launcher by default in clean installations of Workbench (rstudio-pro#3571)
- Enabled all session types (Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio Pro, and VS Code) by default in clean installations of Workbench and added warnings to the Session Launch dialog and the Posit Workbench log when the components for a session type is not installed (rstudio-pro#3689)
- Add support for disabling RStudio Pro sessions (rstudio-pro#3642)

Posit Workbench VS Code Sessions

- Install VS Code session support (code-server) with Posit Workbench instead of requiring a separate download (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Updated code-server to version 4.7.1 (VS Code version 1.71.2) (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Sets the `UVICORN_ROOT_PATH` environment variable to the proxied port URL for port 8000 in VS Code and Jupyter sessions, allowing FastAPI applications to run without additional configuration. (rstudio-pro#2660)
- Workbench now checks for the `code-server` binary in the `WORKBENCH_VSCODE_PATH` environment variable (if present) then the `vscode-exe` setting in `vscode.conf`, or falls back to the preinstalled version and finally the `PATH`. This allows more flexibility when launching sessions on Kubernetes or Slurm clusters. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Add support for launching Workbench Jobs through VS Code Sessions (rstudio-pro#3565)

Posit Workbench VS Code Extension

- Install VS Code Extension with Posit Workbench instead of requiring a separate download (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Introduce Workbench Job management to VS Code Extension (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3784, rstudio/rstudio-pro#3565)
- Added a pop-up notification when working with certain relevant filetypes that makes it easier to find the Workbench Extension. This notification is a one-time view per user. It can be re-enabled in the user settings (vscode-ext#96).
- Rebranded the interface to match Posit Software, PBC's new branding terminology and iconography
- Fixed extension servers appearing in Proxied Servers list (vscode-ext#116)
- Added support for Flask, including a help dialog and the Posit Workbench Flask Interface code snippet, for proxying Flask applications (rstudio-pro#2660)
- Added a FastAPI help dialog and the following code snippets for setting the root_path in FastAPI applications (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3698):
    - Posit Workbench Uvicorn Root Path Snippet
    - Posit Workbench FastAPI Uvicorn Root Path Snippet
- Added a Warning notification that appears when a uvicorn process was started with a custom port, without the root-path argument. These processes will now appear in the Proxied Servers view with a warning icon (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3699)
- Fixed mislabelling of Shiny app in Proxied Servers list (#117)

Posit Workbench Jupyter Sessions

- Workbench now checks for the `jupyter` binary in the `WORKBENCH_JUPYTER_PATH` environment variable (if present), then the `jupyter-exe` setting in `jupyter.conf`, and finally the `PATH`. This is allows more flexibility when launching sessions on Kubernetes or Slurm clusters. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Fixed an issue where Workbench would not install the `jupyter` extension automatically if the configured `jupyter` path was a symlink to the actual install location. We now follow the symlink. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Disabled `session-cull-timeout` in `jupyter.conf` by default for clean installations of Workbench to prevent possible data loss due to Jupyter storing all state in the browser (rstudio-pro#4010)

Posit Workbench Jupyter Extension

- The Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab extensions have been updated to match with the new Posit Software, PBC branding (rstudio-pro#3645)

### Deprecated / Removed

- Removed the Tools / Shell command (#11253)
- Deprecated the vscode.conf "min-ext-version" option for specifying the minimum version of the Posit Workbench VS Code extension as the extension is now bundled with Workbench and Session packages rather than being downloaded (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Removed the "rstudio-server install-vs-code" admin command for downloading and configuring code-server; code-server is now installed with Workbench, use the "rstudio-server configure-vs-code" command for configuration (rstudio-pro#3643)
- It is highly recommended that you disable session culling in Jupyter sessions by done by setting `session-cull-minutes=0` in `jupyter.conf` to prevent potential data loss (rstudio-pro#3054)

### Fixed

- R:
	- Fixed issue in R debugger that caused RStudio to lose focus out of source code when interacting with the console in certain ways, such as evaluating an expression (#10664)
	- Fixed an issue where files would appear to be blank when opened in projects not using UTF-8 encoding on Windows with R 4.2.0. (#11206)
- Ubuntu 22.04 ("Jammy") and Fedora 35 Compatibility:
  - Ubuntu Jammy builds of RStudio using libssl3 to enable installation on Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish 22.04 LTS (#10902)
	- Fixed incompatibility between QtWebEngine and newer glibc by disabling Chromium sandbox, see disclaimer below (#9854)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## glibc 2.34+ and Chromium Sandbox:

For Ubuntu 22.04 ("Jammy"), Fedora 35, and other distros with with newer versions of glibc (>= 2.34) the RStudio Desktop application now disables the Chromium security sandbox in order to workaround a library conflict between the version of chromium used in Qt 5.12 and the platform libraries. The sandbox is a second level security mechanism that prevents untrusted Javascript code from exploiting unknown security problems from using a set of protected system services.

While we will continue to support the Chromium security sandbox for other versions of Linux and in our upcoming Electron version on all platforms, we believe the product security for RStudio Desktop on Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 35 will not be significantly affected even with this security feature disabled. Software security is not a perfect science so we want to be clear about the implications so users can make informed choices.

RStudio Desktop is a developer’s tool that is commonly runs custom code outside of the browser sandbox. Users already must take care to trust the code they run, and are protected by the language and library interfaces they use, as well as a trusted supply chain of package managers. RStudio Desktop either accesses all files on the local system, or connects through an explicit process to trusted servers.

See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0e94f26e8/docs/linux_sandboxing.md#the-sandbox-1 for more details.

- Log files will now rotate by time in addition to the existing rotation by file size. This can be controlled by the `rotate-days` parameter in `logging.conf`.
- For more information, see section 2 of the Admin Guide.

## RStudio 1.4.1717-3

**Juliet Rose**

>Date: 2021-06-01

This is a major update to RStudio 1.4 that includes the following enhancements and bugfixes:

R

- Add native support for Apple Silicon (aarch64) builds of R on macOS (#8652)
- Show memory usage details in Environment pane (#4033)
- Added support for the `|>` pipe operator and the `=>` pipe-bind operator, proposed for R 4.1.0 (#8543)
- Added support for the `\(x)` function shorthand syntax, proposed for R 4.1.0 (#8543)

- Compilation of Sweave documents now uses tinytex when requested (#2788)
- Preliminary support for R graphics engine version 14 in R 4.1.0. (#9251)

Python

- The Python REPL can now be interrupted (#8763, #8785)
- Python installs within `/opt/python` and `/opt/local/python` are now discovered by RStudio (#8852)
- Improved handling of unicode input on Windows (#8549)

- Detect active Python version when publishing content (#8636)
- Use active Python version when knitting R Markdown files (#8854)
- The active version of Python is now placed on the PATH for new Terminal sessions (#9188)

RStudio Workbench

- RStudio Server Pro has been renamed to RStudio Workbench to more accurately reflect its cross-language editing capabilities.
- **BREAKING:** RStudio Workbench's Linux packages have new file names, `rstudio-workbench-*` instead of `rstudio-server-pro-*`. The operating system package name remains `rstudio-server`, so installs and upgrades will work correctly. Scripts which refer to the `.deb` or `.rpm` file names directly will need to be updated.
- Added support for JupyterLab 3 (Pro #2022)
- Add support for using OpenID and SAML authentication schemes when a proxy is required for outbound requests (Pro #2427)
- Updated product licensing engine (LimeLM) to TurboActivate and TurboFloat to v4.4.3.
- Licenses can now be applied and updated without a restart (Pro #2468)
- Improved R session diagnostic logging; now records all instances of a session (Pro #2268)
- Improved troubleshooting logging for PostgreSQL encrypted password configuration (Pro #2441)
- Improved `locktester` file locking diagnostic utility; now tries all lock types and recommends configuration (Pro #2400)
- Added new `rstudio-server reload` command to reload some server configuration settings without a restart (Pro #2139)
- Added `pool-size` option in `database.conf` to control size of database connection pool; avoid creating a large pool on systems with many CPUs (Pro #2494)
- Display hidden characters in filenames when logging config files with `run-diagnostics` (Pro #2509)
- Add support for SSL communication between nodes when using load balancing (Pro #2565)

VS Code

- Visual Studio Code is fully supported on RStudio Workbench and no longer in beta
- Added support for Dash, Streamlit, and local web development servers in VS Code sessions
- Added RStudio Workbench navigation tools in VS Code sessions
- Added a new user settings template file for VSCode settings to allow administrators to specify a default user configuration for VSCode sessions (Pro #2014)
- Set environment variables `RS_URI_SCHEME`, `RS_SESSION_URL`, `SERVER_URL`, and `RS_HOME_URL` when VSCode is launched (Pro #2346, Pro #2373)
- Updated `rstudio-server install-vs-code` to install `code-server` 3.9.3 (Pro #2576)
- **BREAKING** `code-server` 3.3.0 moves the executable to a `bin` directory. After upgrading `code-server`, the `exe` setting in `vscode.conf` may need to be updated to include `bin` in the path. This happens if the upgrade is not done by `install-vs-code-ext` or if `vscode.conf` is being programatically managed. If not updated, VS Code sessions will launch with "wrong version number" message. [Related `code-server` change](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/tag/v3.3.0)
- Change the default behavior of `install-vs-code` to not configure a global extensions directory and allow users to manage their own extensions. If `install-vs-code` was run with a previous release and you'd like to change your configuration, the configuration can be manually removed from `vscode.conf` or the script can be rerun to regenerate `vscode.conf` (Pro #2516) 
- Added `rstudio-server install-vs-code-ext` script to install the RStudio Workbench VS Code extension in a global directory and upgrade `code-server` to 3.9.3 (Pro #2456)
- When a global extensions directory isn't configured, install the RStudio Workbench extension on the first VS Code session launch per user (Pro #2376)
- Disable the extensions marketplace in VS Code sessions when a global directory is configured that the user does not have write access to (Pro #2507)
- Improved error messaging for VS Code session errors from `verify-installation` (Pro #2442)

RStudio Server Open Source

- **BREAKING:** RStudio when served via `http` erroneously reported its own address as `https` during redirects if the header `X-Forwarded-Proto` was defined by a proxy. That could lead to a confusing proxy setup. That has been fixed, but existing proxy installations with redirect rewite settings matching for `https` may have to be adjusted.
- **BREAKING:** RStudio Server no longer supports Internet Explorer 11. 
- Added `session-suspend-on-incomplete-statement` option to enable more aggressive session suspension behavior (Pro #1934)
- New `env-vars` configuration file simplifies setting environment variables for the main RStudio server process. (Pro #2433)
- Refreshed style on sign-in page; sign-in page now has a dark mode that syncs with the operating system's (#9092, #9093)

Visual Editor

- Code chunks in the visual editor now respect the "Tab Key Always Moves Focus" accessibility setting (#8584)
- The commands "Execute Previous Chunks" and "Execute Subsequent Chunks" now work when the cursor is outside a code chunk in the visual editor (#8500)

- Fixed issue where the bibliography path is assumed to be document relative when inserting citations in the visual editor (#8847)
- Fixed error in visual mode spellcheck where underline would disappear when hitting backspace (#9187)

Job Launcher

- Fixed an issue where the Kubernetes Launcher could hang in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environments by lowering the watch-timeout-seconds parameter default down to 3 minutes instead of 5 (Pro #2312)
- Fixed issue preventing Kubernetes sessions from starting due to incorrect SSL certificate checking on websocket connections; make websocket connections support the `verify-ssl-certs` option (Pro #2463)
- Fixed an issue where the Kubernetes Launcher can sometimes get in a state where communication with Kubernetes hangs until a restart (Pro #2548)
- Fixed an issue where Kubernetes Launcher services could sometimes leak and never be cleaned up (Pro #2548)
- Fixed an issue causing Kubernetes plugin to fail to deserialize jobs from Kubernetes 1.19 (Pro #2605)
- Improved a Slurm Session Launch Delay that may occur due to buffering when using Slurm job steps (Pro #2331)
- Fixed an issue where Load Balanced Local Launcher instances could get into a state where they would no longer receive job updates from other nodes due to silent network drops (Pro #2281)

RStudio Server Pro

::: {.callout-note}
- RStudio Server Pro now requires a Postgres database when using its internal load balancer; this database must be set up prior to upgrade from earlier releases. If you have a multi-node RStudio Server Pro installation, consult the Administration Guide for instructions before upgrading.
- RStudio Server Pro uses a new location for user state; .rstudio is now .local/share/rstudio. This is a breaking change if you have symlinked .rstudio and can make downgrade more complicated. See the Administration Guide for more information, including instructions for using the old location if desired for compatibility with previous releases.

## RStudio 0.93.73

>Date: 2011-04-11

### New

Source editor enhancements

We've added some new features & options to the source editor. We've also received lots of feedback on more advanced capabilities users want in the editor and we will definitely address this in upcoming releases. New stuff in the editor includes:

- Highlight all instances of selected text
- Insert spaces for tabs (soft-tabs)
- Customizable print margin line
- Selected line highlight
- Toggle line numbers on/off
- Optional soft-wrapping for R source files

The docs on [source code editing options](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio#editing) include more details.

Customizable layout and appearance

One of the most frequently requested features we've have is the ability to put the Console and Source views side-by-side. This configuration (and others) are now possible. New appearance and layout options include:

- Customize locations of panes and tabs
- Change default font size for code views
- Select from various editor themes including TextMate, Eclipse, and others.

For more details see the docs on [appearance and layout options](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio#appearance).

Interactive plotting (manipulate)

This release includes a package called manipulate that can be use to create interactive plots within RStudio. Manipulate is very flexible and includes the following capabilities:

- Generate plots with inputs bound to custom controls (rather than being hard-coded to a single value)
- Variety of control types including slider, picker, and checkbox.
- Controls appear next to the plot and can be easily shown and hidden

More details as well as screenshots with examples can be found in the [manipulate documentation](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200551906-Interactive-Plotting-with-Manipulate).

Works with R installed from source

The first beta of RStudio was compatible with the binary version of R distributed from CRAN. The current release works with any version of R, including:

- R built and installed from source using make install
- MacPorts or Homebrew versions of R on MacOS X

The docs on [using different versions of R](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200486138-Using-Different-Versions-of-R) describe how RStudio determines which R to run against on each platform.

Character encoding

In this release we've significantly improved handling of non-ASCII characters, this includes:

  * Unicode characters can be used for input and output in the console.
  * The source editor supports Unicode characters and can open/save files using any character encoding.
  * A product-wide default encoding can be set, and can be overridden on a per-document basis.

See the [character encoding](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200532197-Character-Encoding) documentation for more details.

Improved management of working directories

We've added a number of new features to make it easier to switch between working contexts located in different directories. These include:

- Option to specify a default initial working directory
- Tools - Change Working Dir menu command to change both the working directory and Files pane.
- Optional file associations for .RData and .R that initialize RStudio within the opened file's directory
- Windows: Startup in working directory specified for shortcuts
- Mac: Startup in folder dragged and dropped on RStudio Dock icon
- Linux: Startup in terminal working directory when run from the command line

The docs on [working directories and workspaces](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711843-Working-Directories-and-Workspaces) go into more depth on these features.
