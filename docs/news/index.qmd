**"Elsbeth Geranium"**

>Date: 2022-12-15

### New

- RStudio now displays a splash screen on startup, while the R session is being initialized. (#11604)
- Updated RStudio Desktop installer on Windows to detect running RStudio by process name. (#10588)

R

- Whether pending console input is discarded on error can now be controlled via a preference in the Console pane. (#10391)
- Improved handling of diagnostics within pipeline expressions. (#11780)
- Improved handling of diagnostics within glue() expressions.
- Completions within R Markdown documents now respect the `knitr` `root.dir` chunk option if set. (#12047)
- RStudio now provides autocompletion results for packages used but not loaded within a project.
- Improved handling of missing arguments for some functions in the diagnostics system.
- Code editor can show previews of color in strings (R named colors e.g. "tomato3" or of the forms "#rgb", "#rrggbb", "#rrggbbaa") when `Options > Code > Display > [ ] enable preview of named and hexadecimal colors` is checked.
- Fixes the bug introduced with `rlang` >= 1.03 where Rmd documents show the error message `object 'partition_yaml_front_matter' not found` upon project startup. (#11552)
- Name autocompletion following a `$` now correctly quotes names that start with underscore followed by alphanumeric characters. (#11689)
- Suspended sessions will now default to using the project directory, rather than the user home directory, if the prior working directory is no longer accessible. (#11960)
- The fuzzy finder indexes C(++) macros. (#11981)
- Improved handling for large amounts of `message()` output in the Console pane. (#12059)
- Build output is now truncating when very large amounts of output are produced (e.g. from C++ compilation warnings).
- Memory usage in the environment pane now works correctly on Linux when using cgroups v2. (#11894)
- Fixed an issue where code execution could pause in RStudio Server after closing the browser tab even with active computations. (Pro #3943)
- Chunk output calls `format()` method on vctrs-based classes stored in a dataframe. (#6878)
  
Python

- RStudio attempts to infer the appropriate version of Python when "Automatically activate project-local Python environments" is checked and the user has not requested a specific version of Python. This Python will be stored in the environment variable "RETICULATE_PYTHON_FALLBACK", available from the R console, the Python REPL, and the RStudio Terminal (#9990)
- Shiny for Python apps now display a "Run App" button on the Source editor toolbar. (Requires `shiny` Python package v0.2.7 or later.)

Quarto

- Support for v2 format of Quarto crossref index
- Support for RHEL7 and CentOS7 and fixes missing Pandoc for RMarkdown (rstudio-pro#3804)

Posit Workbench

- Rebranded Workbench from RStudio Workbench to Posit Workbench to match Posit Software, PBC's new branding terminology and iconography
- Adds `-l` (long) option to `rserver-url`. When `/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver-url -l <port number>` is executed within a VS Code or Jupyter session, the full URL where a user can view a server proxied at that port is displayed (rstudio-pro#3620)
- Support `launcher-local-proxy` load balancing option to ensure that session requests are always proxied from the local workbench server in a cluster. Eliminates the need to open a range of ports in the firewall for sessions to be reached by other workbench servers (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3670)
- Redesigned the session launch dialog from the homepage to show all session types at once (rstudio-pro#3646)
- Enabled the Job Launcher with the Local Launcher by default in clean installations of Workbench (rstudio-pro#3571)
- Enabled all session types (Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio Pro, and VS Code) by default in clean installations of Workbench and added warnings to the Session Launch dialog and the Posit Workbench log when the components for a session type is not installed (rstudio-pro#3689)
- Add support for disabling RStudio Pro sessions (rstudio-pro#3642)

Posit Workbench VS Code Sessions

- Install VS Code session support (code-server) with Posit Workbench instead of requiring a separate download (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Updated code-server to version 4.7.1 (VS Code version 1.71.2) (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Sets the `UVICORN_ROOT_PATH` environment variable to the proxied port URL for port 8000 in VS Code and Jupyter sessions, allowing FastAPI applications to run without additional configuration. (rstudio-pro#2660)
- Workbench now checks for the `code-server` binary in the `WORKBENCH_VSCODE_PATH` environment variable (if present) then the `vscode-exe` setting in `vscode.conf`, or falls back to the preinstalled version and finally the `PATH`. This allows more flexibility when launching sessions on Kubernetes or Slurm clusters. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Add support for launching Workbench Jobs through VS Code Sessions (rstudio-pro#3565)

Posit Workbench VS Code Extension

- Install VS Code Extension with Posit Workbench instead of requiring a separate download (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Introduce Workbench Job management to VS Code Extension (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3784, rstudio/rstudio-pro#3565)
- Added a pop-up notification when working with certain relevant filetypes that makes it easier to find the Workbench Extension. This notification is a one-time view per user. It can be re-enabled in the user settings (vscode-ext#96).
- Rebranded the interface to match Posit Software, PBC's new branding terminology and iconography
- Fixed extension servers appearing in Proxied Servers list (vscode-ext#116)
- Added support for Flask, including a help dialog and the Posit Workbench Flask Interface code snippet, for proxying Flask applications (rstudio-pro#2660)
- Added a FastAPI help dialog and the following code snippets for setting the root_path in FastAPI applications (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3698):
    - Posit Workbench Uvicorn Root Path Snippet
    - Posit Workbench FastAPI Uvicorn Root Path Snippet
- Added a Warning notification that appears when a uvicorn process was started with a custom port, without the root-path argument. These processes will now appear in the Proxied Servers view with a warning icon (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3699)
- Fixed mislabelling of Shiny app in Proxied Servers list (#117)

Posit Workbench Jupyter Sessions

- Workbench now checks for the `jupyter` binary in the `WORKBENCH_JUPYTER_PATH` environment variable (if present), then the `jupyter-exe` setting in `jupyter.conf`, and finally the `PATH`. This is allows more flexibility when launching sessions on Kubernetes or Slurm clusters. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Fixed an issue where Workbench would not install the `jupyter` extension automatically if the configured `jupyter` path was a symlink to the actual install location. We now follow the symlink. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3942)
- Disabled `session-cull-timeout` in `jupyter.conf` by default for clean installations of Workbench to prevent possible data loss due to Jupyter storing all state in the browser (rstudio-pro#4010)

Posit Workbench Jupyter Extension

- The Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab extensions have been updated to match with the new Posit Software, PBC branding (rstudio-pro#3645)

Experimental ARM64 and RedHat 9 support

- Experimental (preview) support for Linux `aarch64` platforms, such as the Raspberry Pi and AWS Graviton
- Experimental (preview) support for RedHat Enterprise Linux 9 and compatible platforms, such as Rocky Linux 9

- Fixed an issue where chunks containing multibyte characters was not executed correctly (#10632)
- Fixed bringing main window under active secondary window when executing background command (#11407)
- Fix for schema version comparison that breaks db in downgrade -> upgrade scenarios (rstudio-pro#3572)
- Fixed an issue in the Electron build of the IDE on Macs where users could not clone a git repository via password-protected SSH or HTTPS (#11693)
- Fixed scroll speed sensitivity for Mac and Linux and added a preference to adjust it (#11578)
- Fixed an issue in server environments where invoking `systemd` directly could lead to orphaned processes and undefined behavior. Processes are now cleaned up more consistently as a part of server or launcher shutdown. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#2585)
- RStudio sessions now shut down and suspend properly when they receive a `SIGTERM` signal, as they have for `SIGUSR2` (rstudio/rstudio-pro#2585)
- Fixed an issue where `ssl-hsts-include-subdomains=1` would render Workbench non-functional. The setting now works as expected. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3010)
- Fixed an issue where the `suspend-session`, `suspend-all`, and `kill-all` subcommands of `rstudio-server` did not work when using the Launcher. (rstudio/rstudio-pro#4007)
- Fixed conflicting keyboard shortcut for toggling screen reader support on macOS (#12339)
- Fixed issue with session-ssl that prevented resuming some sessions in a load-balanced environment (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3759)
- Fixed intermittent problem where sessions in the Posit Workbench homepage would display incorrect status over NFS (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3979)
- Fixed an issue where Workbench Job output would somtimes fail to show (rstudio-pro#3972)

### Deprecated / Removed

- Removed the Tools / Shell command (#11253)
- Deprecated the vscode.conf "min-ext-version" option for specifying the minimum version of the Posit Workbench VS Code extension as the extension is now bundled with Workbench and Session packages rather than being downloaded (rstudio-pro#3643)
- Removed the "rstudio-server install-vs-code" admin command for downloading and configuring code-server; code-server is now installed with Workbench, use the "rstudio-server configure-vs-code" command for configuration (rstudio-pro#3643)
- It is highly recommended that you disable session culling in Jupyter sessions by done by setting `session-cull-minutes=0` in `jupyter.conf` to prevent potential data loss (rstudio-pro#3054)

  - Added support for blurred text (#11019)
  - "Clean and Rebuild" and "Install and Restart" have been merged into "Install Package", the "Project Options > Build" gains a "clean before install" option to toggle the --preclean flag. The Build toolbar changes to "Install | Test | Check | More v" (#4289)
  - The source button uses `cpp11::source_cpp()` on C++ files that have `[[cpp11::register]]` decorations (#10387)

R:

- Fixes the bug introduced with rlang >= 1.03 where Rmd documents show the error message object 'partition_yaml_front_matter' not found upon project startup (#11552)

### Fixed

- Fixed for schema version comparison that breaks db in downgrade -> upgrade scenarios (rstudio-pro#3572)


## RStudio 2022.02.3+492.pro3

**"Prairie Trillium"**

>Date: 2022-05-17

### Fixed

- R:
	- Fixed issue in R debugger that caused RStudio to lose focus out of source code when interacting with the console in certain ways, such as evaluating an expression (#10664)
	- Fixed an issue where files would appear to be blank when opened in projects not using UTF-8 encoding on Windows with R 4.2.0. (#11206)
- Ubuntu 22.04 ("Jammy") and Fedora 35 Compatibility:
  - Ubuntu Jammy builds of RStudio using libssl3 to enable installation on Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish 22.04 LTS (#10902)
	- Fixed incompatibility between QtWebEngine and newer glibc by disabling Chromium sandbox, see disclaimer below (#9854)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## glibc 2.34+ and Chromium Sandbox:

For Ubuntu 22.04 ("Jammy"), Fedora 35, and other distros with with newer versions of glibc (>= 2.34) the RStudio Desktop application now disables the Chromium security sandbox in order to workaround a library conflict between the version of chromium used in Qt 5.12 and the platform libraries. The sandbox is a second level security mechanism that prevents untrusted Javascript code from exploiting unknown security problems from using a set of protected system services.

While we will continue to support the Chromium security sandbox for other versions of Linux and in our upcoming Electron version on all platforms, we believe the product security for RStudio Desktop on Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 35 will not be significantly affected even with this security feature disabled. Software security is not a perfect science so we want to be clear about the implications so users can make informed choices.

RStudio Desktop is a developer’s tool that is commonly runs custom code outside of the browser sandbox. Users already must take care to trust the code they run, and are protected by the language and library interfaces they use, as well as a trusted supply chain of package managers. RStudio Desktop either accesses all files on the local system, or connects through an explicit process to trusted servers.

See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0e94f26e8/docs/linux_sandboxing.md#the-sandbox-1 for more details.

- Detect active Python version when publishing content (#8636)
- Use active Python version when knitting R Markdown files (#8854)
- The active version of Python is now placed on the PATH for new Terminal sessions (#9188)

RStudio Workbench

- RStudio Server Pro has been renamed to RStudio Workbench to more accurately reflect its cross-language editing capabilities.
- **BREAKING:** RStudio Workbench's Linux packages have new file names, `rstudio-workbench-*` instead of `rstudio-server-pro-*`. The operating system package name remains `rstudio-server`, so installs and upgrades will work correctly. Scripts which refer to the `.deb` or `.rpm` file names directly will need to be updated.
- Added support for JupyterLab 3 (Pro #2022)
- Add support for using OpenID and SAML authentication schemes when a proxy is required for outbound requests (Pro #2427)
- Updated product licensing engine (LimeLM) to TurboActivate and TurboFloat to v4.4.3.
- Licenses can now be applied and updated without a restart (Pro #2468)
- Improved R session diagnostic logging; now records all instances of a session (Pro #2268)
- Improved troubleshooting logging for PostgreSQL encrypted password configuration (Pro #2441)
- Improved `locktester` file locking diagnostic utility; now tries all lock types and recommends configuration (Pro #2400)
- Added new `rstudio-server reload` command to reload some server configuration settings without a restart (Pro #2139)
- Added `pool-size` option in `database.conf` to control size of database connection pool; avoid creating a large pool on systems with many CPUs (Pro #2494)
- Display hidden characters in filenames when logging config files with `run-diagnostics` (Pro #2509)
- Add support for SSL communication between nodes when using load balancing (Pro #2565)

VS Code

- Visual Studio Code is fully supported on RStudio Workbench and no longer in beta
- Added support for Dash, Streamlit, and local web development servers in VS Code sessions
- Added RStudio Workbench navigation tools in VS Code sessions
- Added a new user settings template file for VSCode settings to allow administrators to specify a default user configuration for VSCode sessions (Pro #2014)
- Set environment variables `RS_URI_SCHEME`, `RS_SESSION_URL`, `SERVER_URL`, and `RS_HOME_URL` when VSCode is launched (Pro #2346, Pro #2373)
- Updated `rstudio-server install-vs-code` to install `code-server` 3.9.3 (Pro #2576)
- **BREAKING** `code-server` 3.3.0 moves the executable to a `bin` directory. After upgrading `code-server`, the `exe` setting in `vscode.conf` may need to be updated to include `bin` in the path. This happens if the upgrade is not done by `install-vs-code-ext` or if `vscode.conf` is being programatically managed. If not updated, VS Code sessions will launch with "wrong version number" message. [Related `code-server` change](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/tag/v3.3.0)
- Change the default behavior of `install-vs-code` to not configure a global extensions directory and allow users to manage their own extensions. If `install-vs-code` was run with a previous release and you'd like to change your configuration, the configuration can be manually removed from `vscode.conf` or the script can be rerun to regenerate `vscode.conf` (Pro #2516) 
- Added `rstudio-server install-vs-code-ext` script to install the RStudio Workbench VS Code extension in a global directory and upgrade `code-server` to 3.9.3 (Pro #2456)
- When a global extensions directory isn't configured, install the RStudio Workbench extension on the first VS Code session launch per user (Pro #2376)
- Disable the extensions marketplace in VS Code sessions when a global directory is configured that the user does not have write access to (Pro #2507)
- Improved error messaging for VS Code session errors from `verify-installation` (Pro #2442)

RStudio Server Open Source

- **BREAKING:** RStudio when served via `http` erroneously reported its own address as `https` during redirects if the header `X-Forwarded-Proto` was defined by a proxy. That could lead to a confusing proxy setup. That has been fixed, but existing proxy installations with redirect rewite settings matching for `https` may have to be adjusted.
- **BREAKING:** RStudio Server no longer supports Internet Explorer 11. 
- Added `session-suspend-on-incomplete-statement` option to enable more aggressive session suspension behavior (Pro #1934)
- New `env-vars` configuration file simplifies setting environment variables for the main RStudio server process. (Pro #2433)
- Refreshed style on sign-in page; sign-in page now has a dark mode that syncs with the operating system's (#9092, #9093)

Visual Editor

- Code chunks in the visual editor now respect the "Tab Key Always Moves Focus" accessibility setting (#8584)
- The commands "Execute Previous Chunks" and "Execute Subsequent Chunks" now work when the cursor is outside a code chunk in the visual editor (#8500)

- Fixed issue where the bibliography path is assumed to be document relative when inserting citations in the visual editor (#8847)
- Fixed error in visual mode spellcheck where underline would disappear when hitting backspace (#9187)

Job Launcher

- Fixed an issue where the Kubernetes Launcher could hang in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environments by lowering the watch-timeout-seconds parameter default down to 3 minutes instead of 5 (Pro #2312)
- Fixed issue preventing Kubernetes sessions from starting due to incorrect SSL certificate checking on websocket connections; make websocket connections support the `verify-ssl-certs` option (Pro #2463)
- Fixed an issue where the Kubernetes Launcher can sometimes get in a state where communication with Kubernetes hangs until a restart (Pro #2548)
- Fixed an issue where Kubernetes Launcher services could sometimes leak and never be cleaned up (Pro #2548)
- Fixed an issue causing Kubernetes plugin to fail to deserialize jobs from Kubernetes 1.19 (Pro #2605)
- Improved a Slurm Session Launch Delay that may occur due to buffering when using Slurm job steps (Pro #2331)

## RStudio 0.93.73

>Date: 2011-04-11

### New

Source editor enhancements

We've added some new features & options to the source editor. We've also received lots of feedback on more advanced capabilities users want in the editor and we will definitely address this in upcoming releases. New stuff in the editor includes:

- Highlight all instances of selected text
- Insert spaces for tabs (soft-tabs)
- Customizable print margin line
- Selected line highlight
- Toggle line numbers on/off
- Optional soft-wrapping for R source files

The docs on [source code editing options](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/customizing#editing) include more details.

Customizable layout and appearance

One of the most frequently requested features we've have is the ability to put the Console and Source views side-by-side. This configuration (and others) are now possible. New appearance and layout options include:

- Customize locations of panes and tabs
- Change default font size for code views
- Select from various editor themes including TextMate, Eclipse, and others.

For more details see the docs on [appearance and layout options](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/customizing#appearance).

Interactive plotting (manipulate)

This release includes a package called manipulate that can be use to create interactive plots within RStudio. Manipulate is very flexible and includes the following capabilities:

- Generate plots with inputs bound to custom controls (rather than being hard-coded to a single value)
- Variety of control types including slider, picker, and checkbox.
- Controls appear next to the plot and can be easily shown and hidden

More details as well as screenshots with examples can be found in the [manipulate documentation](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/advanced/manipulate).

Works with R installed from source

The first beta of RStudio was compatible with the binary version of R distributed from CRAN. The current release works with any version of R, including:

- R built and installed from source using make install
- MacPorts or Homebrew versions of R on MacOS X

The docs on [using different versions of R](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/advanced/versions_of_r) describe how RStudio determines which R to run against on each platform.

Character encoding

In this release we've significantly improved handling of non-ASCII characters, this includes:

  * Unicode characters can be used for input and output in the console.
  * The source editor supports Unicode characters and can open/save files using any character encoding.
  * A product-wide default encoding can be set, and can be overridden on a per-document basis.

See the [character encoding](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/advanced/encoding) documentation for more details.

Improved management of working directories

We've added a number of new features to make it easier to switch between working contexts located in different directories. These include:

- Option to specify a default initial working directory
- Tools - Change Working Dir menu command to change both the working directory and Files pane.
- Optional file associations for .RData and .R that initialize RStudio within the opened file's directory
- Windows: Startup in working directory specified for shortcuts
- Mac: Startup in folder dragged and dropped on RStudio Dock icon
- Linux: Startup in terminal working directory when run from the command line

The docs on [working directories and workspaces](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/workspaces) go into more depth on these features.
