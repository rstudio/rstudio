RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows 10+, macOS 14+, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or Posit Workbench. Development of the open source and commercial RStudio IDE variants is supported by Posit Software, PBC (formerly named RStudio, PBC). Please review our [Blog post/FAQ](https://pos.it/rebrand-faq/) for additional information about the rebrand.

RStudio includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace. 

Please visit the individual product pages for additional information about the open source [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) or RStudio within [Posit Workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/workbench/). 

Some of the functionality that RStudio provides is:

-   Access RStudio locally.  
-   Syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart indentation.  
-   Execute R code directly from the source editor.  
-   Quickly jump to function definitions.  
-   View content changes in real-time with the Visual Markdown Editor for RMarkdown or Quarto documents.  
-   Easily manage multiple working directories using Projects.  
-   Integrated R help and documentation.  
-   View Python data, publish and render in Python and share objects with R.  
-   Interactive debugger to diagnose and fix errors.  
-   Extensive package development tools.  
-   Easily publish apps and reports.
