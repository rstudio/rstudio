R packages such as `readr`, `arrow`, `data.table`, `readxl`, and `haven` provide functions to read in various formats of datasets. RStudio also provides an **Import Dataset** wizard for common file types which can also output the requisite R code to reproduce.

## Importing data

The data import features can be accessed from the **Environment pane** or from the **Tools** menu. The importers are grouped into 3 categories: 

- Text data 
- Excel data 
- Statistical data 

To access this feature, use the **Import Dataset** dropdown from the **Environment** pane:

Or through the RStudio menu: **File** \> **Import Dataset**

## Importing data from Text and CSV files

Importing "From Text (readr)" files allows reading in CSV files and in general, character delimited files using the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. The **Import Text Data** wizard provides support to:

-   Import from the file system or a url

-   Change column data types

-   Skip or include-only columns

-   Rename the data set

-   Skip the first N rows

-   Use the header row for column names

-   Trim spaces in names

-   Change the column delimiter

-   Encoding selection

-   Select quote, escape, comment and NA identifiers

For example, a csv can be imported by pasting this url <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv> and selecting "Import".

## Importing data from Text files

Importing using "From Text (base)" enables importing text files using the base R package:

## Importing data from Excel files

The Excel importer provides support to:

-   Import from the file system or a url

-   Change column data types

-   Skip columns

-   Rename the data set

-   Select an specific Excel sheet

-   Skip the first N rows

-   Select NA identifiers

For example, the **Import Excel Data** wizard can import an xls file from the `readxl` R package by pasting this url <https://github.com/tidyverse/readxl/blob/main/inst/extdata/deaths.xlsx?raw=true> and pressing **Update**.

This file contains text at the top of the file and therefore, requires the first few rows to be removed, which can be accomplished by changing `Skip: 4` and pressing **Update**.

The final step is to press **Import** to execute the code under "Code Preview" and import the data into RStudio.

## Importing data from SPSS, SAS and Stata files

The SPSS, SAS and Stata importer provides support to:

-   Import from the file system or a url

-   Rename the data set

-   Specify a model file

An example `.sav` file is available at: <https://github.com/rstudio/webinars/raw/master/23-Importing-Data-into-R/data/Child_Data.sav>. Paste that url under "File/Url" and press **Update** and then press **Import**.
