As mentioned in [RStudio Jobs](jobs.html), RStudio has the ability to send long running R scripts to [local and remote background jobs](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-1-2-jobs/). This functionality can dramatically improve the productivity of data scientists and analysts using R since they can continue working in RStudio while jobs are running in the background.

A few examples of integrating RStudio Jobs with specific development workflows in shiny, plumber, machine learning, or any long-running process are documented below.

## Shiny app

Running a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) for R application as a local background job allows the current R session to remain free to work on other things. This can be especially helpful for making changes to the Shiny code and seeing the changes in real time.

A minimal example of running the Shiny app as a Job is documented below.

Use the RStudio global menu:  

- **File** \> **New File** \> **Shiny Web App\...** 
- Set the **Application Name:** as "shiny-example"  
- Set the **Application Type:** as a **Single File (app.R)**  

![](images/create-new-shiny.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the RStudio > New Shiny Web Application wizard, populated with the above instructions."}

This workflow will create a new folder titled "shiny-example" and populate it with a Shiny `app.R` file. In the *same folder* ("shiny-example") as the newly created `app.R`, create a second .R file titled `shiny-local.R` with the following example code:

``` r
options(shiny.autoreload=TRUE)
shiny::runApp()
```

The `shiny.autoreload=TRUE` option provides the real-time updating of the Shiny app code without requiring an explicit reload of the Shiny app, and the `shiny::runApp()` code enables running all the Shiny components within the "shiny-example" folder. Sourcing as a `shiny-local.R` from within the same directory as a Shiny `app.R` will allow them to interact, using `shiny-local.R` to modify the behavior of the Shiny hosting. 

The purpose of this two-file system is that you have a ready to deploy Shiny app (`app.R`) and a way to interactively test it locally (`shiny-local.R`) prior to deploying to production.

The `shiny-local.R` source file will have a **Run App** drop-down menu. From the **Run App** drop-down, select **In Background Job** and then press the **Run App** button:

![](images/run-shiny-background.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the `shiny-local.R` file, with the Run App > In Background Job menu option highlighted."}

With **In Background Job** set, the **Run App** button will execute the Shiny app in a Background Job, and automatically present it in the **Viewer Pane**:

![](images/live-reload-shiny.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the RStudio interface, displaying the Shiny app running as a Background Job, displaying the shiny app in the Viewer pane."}

Working with Shiny apps in this way allows for interactive editing and updating of the displayed Shiny app in real time - both for Shiny user interface and server components.

### Reload app

Alternatively, in the Shiny `app.R` file, there will also be a **Run App** drop-down. From **Run App**, select **In Background Job** and then press the **Run App** button. This will not have auto-reloading but might be preferable for Shiny apps with a long startup time.

In this scenario, after making changes to the `app.R` file, the **Run App** button will be replaced with a **Reload App** button. The Shiny app will still be executed in a Background Job, but the user must explicitly reload the app after making changes and press the **Reload App** button, rather than the auto-reload behavior in the previous example.

![](images/reload-app-shiny.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a shiny app.R file with the Run App button replaced with Reload App, indicating that changes have been made and the app can be updated when the user decides."}

## Plumber API

Similar to Shiny applications, [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) APIs can be run as a local background job. This allows the current R session to remain open for things like testing or interacting with the API via `curl` or R packages for querying APIs such as [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/). [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) v1.1.0 or later is required for the below documentation.

If necessary, install the latest version of plumber and rapidoc from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages(c("plumber", "rapidoc))
```

A minimal example of running a plumber API as a Job is documented below:

Use the RStudio global menu: **File** \> **New File** \> **Plumber API\...** and save it as `plumber-example`.

In the *same directory* as `plumber.R`, create a second .R file titled `plumber-local.R` with the following example code:

``` r
library(plumber)
library(rapidoc)
pr("plumber.R") %>%
  pr_set_docs("rapidoc") %>%
  pr_set_docs_callback(rstudioapi::viewer) %>%
  pr_run()
```

This code will take an example plumber API, set rapidoc as the interactive documentation, and send the docs to the RStudio **Viewer** pane. The purpose of this two-file system is that you have a ready to deploy plumber API (`plumber.R`) and a way to interactively test it locally (`plumber-local.R`) prior to deploying to production.

Execute it as a Job from the **Source** pane via the **Source** \> **Source as a Background Job** drop-down option.

![](images/source-plumber-job.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Source pane, with the Source > Source as Background Job drop-down option highlighted."}

In the upper-right corner of the RStudio **Viewer** pane, press the **Refresh Viewer** ![](images/reload-button.png){height=20}. This will display the plumber API's rapidoc interface in the **Viewer** pane, allowing for interactive testing with the active plumber API in real time.

![](images/plumber-interaction.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of RStudio with the plumber-job.R file open in the Source pane, the Background job tab selected from the Console pane displaying the url to the API and it's docs, and the Viewer pane displaying the plumber API's Swagger docs."} 

To interact with the API programatically in RStudio, use a R package such as [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/) or a command line tool such as [curl](https://curl.se/). The example API has a few endpoints (`/sum`, `/echo`, `/plot`) and you can query them with `GET()` or `POST()` commands.

```r
# if needed install.packages("httr")
```

From the **Background Jobs** tab within the **Console** pane, the running API will return the URL to the API and it's rapidoc Docs:

![](images/plumber-job-url.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Background Jobs pane, displaying the example URL to the API and the rapidoc docs."}

``` bash
# This is an example URL and 
# it will vary between sessions
Running plumber API at http://127.0.0.1:6285
Running rapidoc Docs at http://127.0.0.1:6285/docs/
```

We can add specific endpoints to that URL (`http://127.0.0.1:6285`) such as `/sum` or `/echo` and then query them with the httr package.

```r
post_sum <- httr::POST("http://127.0.0.1:6285/sum", query = list(a=1, b = 2))

httr::content(post_sum)
#> [1] 3
```

```r
get_echo <- httr::GET("http://127.0.0.1:6285/echo", query = list(msg = "dog"))

httr::content(get_echo)
#> $msg
#> [1] "The message is: 'dog'"
```


## vetiver model as an API

The [vetiver framework](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/) is for MLOps tasks in Python and R. The [vetiver R package](https://rstudio.github.io/vetiver-r/) has functions for deploying vetiver models as plumber APIs. This allows for remote deployment, as well as local testing in a similar way to generic plumber APIs. The vetiver example below is taken from the [vetiver 'Get Started' documentation](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/get-started/deploy.html).

If necessary, install the latest versions of these packages from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages(c("tidymodels", "vetiver", "pins", "plumber"))
```

First, save the below code as `vetiver-train.R` and execute it to generate a vetiver model and write out that model to a plumber API.

``` r
library(tidymodels)
library(vetiver)
library(pins)

car_mod <-
    workflow(mpg ~ ., decision_tree(mode = "regression")) %>%
    fit(mtcars)
v <- vetiver_model(car_mod, "cars_mpg")
model_board <- board_folder("pins-r", versioned = TRUE)
model_board %>% vetiver_pin_write(v)

# write out a vetiver model to a plumber API
vetiver_write_plumber(model_board, "cars_mpg", file = "vetiver-plumber.R")
```

Create and save a second file as `vetiver-local.R` with the code below:

``` r
# vetiver-local.R
library(plumber)
library(vetiver)

pr("vetiver-plumber.R") %>%
  pr_set_docs_callback(rstudioapi::viewer) %>%
  pr_run()
```

The `vetiver-local.R` file can be run as a **Background Job** like any other plumber API, hosting the vetiver model as an API temporarily. The purpose of this two-file system is that you have a ready to deploy vetiver model as a plumber API (`vetiver-plumber.R`) and a way to interactively test it locally (`vetiver-local.R`) prior to deploying to production.

If you don't want to write out the plumber API yet, you can also launch a vetiver API directly with vetiver. This requires selecting **Run job with copy of global environment** when pressing **Source as Background Job**, as the `vetiver_model()` exists in the global environment as `v` in the current example:

```r
pr() %>%
  pr_set_docs_callback(rstudioapi::viewer) %>%
  # use the existing vetiver_model object 'v'
  vetiver_api(v) %>%
  pr_run()
```

From the **Source** drop-down menu, select **Source as Background Job**. This will launch the API as a **Background Job**. 

![](images/vetiver-source-background-job.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Source pane, with the Source > Source as Background Job drop-down option highlighted."}

In the upper-right corner of the RStudio **Viewer** pane, press the **Refresh Viewer** ![](images/reload-button.png){height=20}. This will display the API's interface in the **Viewer** pane, allowing for interactive testing of the temporarily hosted vetiver model in real time.

![](images/vetiver-view-docs.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of RStudio with the vetiver-local.R file open in the Source pane, the Console pane displaying the url to the API and it's docs, and the Viewer pane displaying the vetiver model API's rapidocs docs."}

You can also programatically send new data and test new predictions with the vetiver model. In the **Background Jobs** tab within the **Console** pane, the active API will return the URL to the API and it's rapidoc Docs.

![](images/vetiver-docs-url.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Background Jobs pane, displaying the example URL to the API and the rapidoc docs."}

``` bash
# This is an example URL and 
# it will vary between sessions
Running plumber API at http://127.0.0.1:6030
Running rapidoc Docs at http://127.0.0.1:6030/__docs__/
```

Add the `/predict` endpoint to the end of the URL and save it as a `vetiver_endpoint()`.

``` r
endpoint <- vetiver_endpoint("http://127.0.0.1:6030/predict")
```

You can then make predictions with new data for that model running in the separate **Background Job** process.

``` r
new_car <- tibble(cyl = 4,  disp = 200, 
                  hp = 100, drat = 3,
                  wt = 3,   qsec = 17, 
                  vs = 0,   am = 1,
                  gear = 4, carb = 2)
predict(endpoint, new_car)

#> # A tibble: 11 × 1
#>    .pred
#>    <chr>      
#>  1 22.3
```

## Extract, transform, load (ETL)

Background and Workbench Jobs are ideal for long running processes, like interactively loading data from an external database or API. Non-interactive, scheduled ETL scripts should be handled by Posit Connect.

## Simulations

Long running tasks like simulation studies can be run as background or Workbench Jobs in order to keep the original R session open for other work.

For example - a Monte Carlo simulation for estimating pi could be saved as `simulate-pi.R`:

<details>

<summary>`simulate-pi.R` Code</summary>

``` r
# Use a monto carlo simulation to estimate pi
n <- 1e6
if (!dir.exists("output")) dir.create("output")
results_file <- tempfile("pi-", "output", ".rds")

results <- matrix(nrow = n, ncol = 2)

for (i in 1:n){
   results[i,] <- runif(2)
   # save out results every 25 iterations
   if (i %% 25 == 0) {
      print(paste0("Saving results (i = ", i, ")"))
      save_results <- results[apply(results, 1, function(x) !all(is.na(x))),]
      print(
         paste0(
            "Pi estimate: ",
            mean((save_results[,1]^2 + save_results[,2]^2) <= 1) * 4)
      )
      saveRDS(save_results, results_file)
   }
}
```

</details>

This script includes:

-   `print()` calls for each 25 runs and the estimation of pi at that moment in time
-   `saveRDS()` to save out and overwrite the results after each 25 runs

Executing this script as a Job with the included `print()` calls will display the current estimated value of Pi and a running number of simulations in the Background Jobs pane:

![](images/estimating-pi-output.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the Background Jobs pane displaying the output of the current estimated value of Pi and that it is being saved to a file along with the number of simulations."}

## Model training

Model training and tuning, which can often take a long time, is another great use case for background and Workbench Jobs. Local jobs are ideal for sequential model training while Workbench Jobs can be used to train multiple models in parallel on elastic scaling infrastructure.

The example script at <https://tune.tidymodels.org/reference/example_ames_knn.html> can be executed as a background or Workbench Job, enhanced with one modification.

Add `control = control_grid(verbose = TRUE)` to the `tune_grid()` step:

``` r
ames_grid_search <-
  tune_grid(
    ames_wflow,
    resamples = rs_splits,
    grid = ames_grid,
    # this will print each step of the tuning process
    control = control_grid(verbose = TRUE)
  )
```

Including the `control_grid(verbose = TRUE)` means the output from that grid tuning of a tidymodels workflow will print and update wherever it is being executed, including the **Background Jobs** tab. For this code it will print the current fold and split:

![](images/tidymodels-control-grid.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the output from grid tuning of a tidymodels workflows with printing in the **Background Jobs** tab, including the current fold and split."}

## Programmatic Jobs

The above documentation has focused on using the RStudio user interface to kick off and interact with Jobs. The [`rstudioapi`](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudioapi) package provides tools for programmatically creating local and Workbench jobs.
