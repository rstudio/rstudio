RStudio supports syntax highlighting and other specialized code-editing features for specific file types:

-   R, Python, and SQL scripts

-   R Markdown, Quarto, and other markdown documents

-   HTML files

-   TeX documents

-   and many more

## File Menu

To create a new file you use the **File -\> New File** menu:

An alternative workflow is to use the visual elements in the RStudio menu.

To open an existing file you use either the **File -\> Open File\...** menu or the **Recent Files** menu to select from recently opened files.

## Files tab

The **Output** pane has a **Files** tab that includes several buttons for managing files within the currently selected folder.

## Switching files

If you open several files within RStudio they are all available as tabs within the **Source** pane to facilitate quick switching between open documents. If you have a large number of open documents you can also navigate between them using the "**\>\>"** icon at the end of the tab bar or the **View -\> Switch to Tab\...**) menu item:

You can quickly navigate to an existing file in the current RStudio Project via the <kbd>Ctrl + .</kbd> shortcut which will bring up the **Go to File/Function** search bar with auto-completion of file names.
