## Switching Global Themes

RStudio provides support for two global themes that customize the RStudio IDE's user interface: Modern and Sky. By default, the Modern theme is selected.

The Modern theme flattens all user interface elements with a default white background, while the Sky theme has a light blue background.

To switch between RStudio themes, from the **Tools** \> **Global Options \> Appearance** menu, use the **RStudio theme** dropdown.

## Editor Themes

RStudio provides support for adding custom editor themes in one of two formats: tmTheme or rstheme. The tmTheme format was first introduced for TextMate, and has since become one of the standard formats for themes. This [tmTheme editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) also includes a large collection of tmThemes. The rstheme format is specific to RStudio.

To switch between the Editor themes, from the **Tools** \> **Global Options \> Appearance** menu, use the **Editor theme** selector. A number of common themes are included, but users can also define and uploaded their own themes.

## Creating Custom Themes for RStudio

User defined themes are supported in one of two formats: tmTheme and rstheme. A tmTheme is an XML based theme description first introduced by the text editor TextMate. An rstheme is a CSS based theme format designed to work specifically with RStudio. When a tmTheme is added to RStudio, it is converted to an rstheme before it is saved locally. To create a new theme for RStudio, you can write a tmTheme and import it to RStudio, write an rstheme, or write a tmTheme and then modify the rstheme that RStudio will generate for you.

## Creating a tmTheme

To create a new tmTheme from scratch you can use a tmTheme editor like [this one](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/), or write it by hand. tmTheme files are very general and may include any scope the writer wishes; however, RStudio only supports a certain set of scopes. Below, you can find a table that describes the scopes supported by RStudio and the impact they will have on your resulting theme:

| Scope                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Creating an rstheme

While an rstheme can be written from scratch, they contain a fair amount of generated values. The most straightforward method to create one would be to write a tmTheme and import to RStudio and then modify the generated rstheme. Another straightforward method would be to copy an existing rstheme and then modify the values.

Because of the structure of the elements being styled, not all the CSS rule sets may end up being used. Below is a table that describes the most relevant selectors, which tmTheme scope they correspond to, if any, and how they impact the style of RStudio.

| Selector                                     | Scope                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

In addition to these rule sets, you will also find a number of rule sets related to the Terminal pane, with selectors that include `.terminal` or selectors that begin with `.xterm`. It is possible to change these values as well, but it may be advisable to keep a back up copy of your original theme in case you don't like any of the changes. There are also a number of classes that can be used to modify parts of RStudio unrelated to the editor. These classes are all prefixed with `rstheme_`, with the exception of `dataGridHeader` and `themedPopupPanel`. Any classes you find in the html of RStudio which are not prefixed with `rstheme_`, `ace_`, or explicitly listed in this article are subject to change at anytime, and so are unsafe to use in custom themes.

Since an rstheme is just CSS, anything that you can do with CSS you can do in an rstheme.

## Testing Changes to a Theme

If you're modifying a theme which has already been added to RStudio, you may need to restart RStudio desktop in order to make the changes take effect.

## Sharing a Theme

Once you're satisfied with your theme, you can easily share it with anyone by simply sharing the tmTheme or rstheme file. You can find rstheme files in `C:\\Users\\<your user account>\\Documents\\.R\\rstudio\\themes` on Windows and `~/.R/rstudio/themes` on linux and Mac.

## Themes API

For those interested in authoring packages or integrating themes programmatically, you can make use of the [rstudioapi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstudioapi/index.html) package.

Then we can query the current theme using:

`rstudioapi::getThemeInfo()`

which, for the Modern theme and Xcode this function would return:

`$editor[1] "Xcode"$global[1] "Modern"$dark[1] TRUE`

This can be used to properly customize the output from your package to match the RStudio theme selected by each user.

To add a new rstheme, use:

`rstudioapi::addTheme(themePath, apply, force, globally)`

which returns the name of the newly added theme. It's parameters are described below:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `themePath`   | A full or relative path or URL to the rstheme file to add.                                        |
| `apply`       | Whether to immediately apply the newly added theme. Default: `FALSE`.                             |
| `force`       | Whether to force the add operation if a file with the same name already exists. Default: `FALSE`. |
| `globally`    | Whether to add the theme for all users (`TRUE`) or the current user (`FALSE`). Default: `FALSE`.  |

To add a new tmTheme, use:

`rstudioapi::convertTheme(themePath, add, outputLocation, apply, force, globally)`

which also returns the name of the newly added theme. It's parameters are described in the table below:

| **Parameter**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `themePath`      | A full or relative path to the tmTheme file to add.                                                                                                                                |
| `add`            | Whether to add the converted theme to RStudio immediately. Default: `TRUE`.                                                                                                        |
| `outputLocation` | A full or relative path where an additional copy of the converted theme will be saved. If this value is not set and add is set to `FALSE`, no file will be saved. Default: `NULL`. |
| `apply`          | Whether to immediately apply the newly added theme. Default: `FALSE`.                                                                                                              |
| `force`          | Whether to force the add operation if a file with the same name already exists. Default: `FALSE`.                                                                                  |
| `globally`       | Whether to add the theme for all users (`TRUE`) or the current user (`FALSE`). Default: `FALSE`.                                                                                   |

To apply a particular theme use:

`rstudioapi::applyTheme(name)`

where `name` is the name of theme returned by `rstudioapi::getThemes()`.

To remove a custom theme use:

`rstudioapi::removeTheme(name)`

where `name` is the name of theme returned by `rstudioapi::getThemes()`.

To list all the available editor themes, use:

`rstudioapi::getThemes()`

which returns a list of themes in the format `id = list(name = "a theme name", isDark = TRUE)`. For example, some values in the list would look like:

``` code
$ambiance
ambiance$name
[1] "Ambiance"

$ambiance$isDark
[1] TRUE

$chaos
$chaos$name
[1] "Chaos"

$chaos$isDark
[1] TRUE

$chrome
$chrome$name
[1] "Chrome"

$chrome$isDark
[1] FALSE
```
