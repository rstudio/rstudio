title: "Text Editor"

RStudio's source editor includes a variety of productivity enhancing features including syntax highlighting, code completion, multiple-file editing, and find/replace.

RStudio also enables flexible execution of R code directly from the source editor. For many R developers this represents their preferred way of working with R. Working in the source editor makes it much easier to reproduce sequences of commands and to package commands for re-use as a function. These features are described in the [Executing Code](../code/execution.html) section of the user guide.

The core features listed below are accessible via the **Code Tools** "Magic Wand" dropdown menu in the **Source** pane.

Most of these features have corresponding keyboard shortcuts, which also means they can be accessed via the Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P</kbd>).

## Code completion

RStudio supports the automatic completion of code using the **Tab** key. For example, start typing `return` as `ret` then **Tab** and RStudio will automatically complete the full name of the function or object.

Code completion also works in the console, and more details on using it can be found in the console [Console](../code/console.html) documentation.

## Extract Function

RStudio can analyze a selection of code from within the source editor and automatically convert it into a re-usable function. Any "free" variables within the selection (objects that are referenced but not created within the selection) are converted into function arguments:

## Find and Replace

RStudio supports finding and replacing text within source documents:

Find and replace can be opened using the <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> shortcut key, or from the **Edit** > **Find\...** menu item. Replacement can be done all at once or by stepping through each instance.

## Comment/Uncomment

RStudio provides the ability to comment and uncomment entire selections of code using the **Code > Comment/Uncomment Lines** menu item or with the <kbd>Command+Shift + C</kbd> keyboard shortcut.

## Multiple Cursors

-   Press **Ctrl + Alt + {Up/Down}** to create a new cursor in the pressed direction,

-   Press **Ctrl + Alt + Shift + {Direction}** to move a second cursor in the specified direction,

-   Use **Alt** and drag with the mouse to create a rectangular selection,

-   Use **Alt + Shift** and click to create a rectangular selection from the current cursor position to the clicked position.

Use the "All" button on the **Find/Replace** toolbar to create cursors at each instance of a word.

## Move lines up/down

Text or code in source files can be moved up or down by the <kbd>Alt+Up/Down</kbd> (<kbd>Option+Up/Down</kbd> on Mac). This applies to individual lines of code where the cursor is, as well as to multiline selections.

## Copy lines up/down

Text or code in source files can be moved up or down with the <kbd>Shift+Alt+Up/Down</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd+Option+Up/Down</kbd> on Mac) shortcut. This applies to individual lines of code where the cursor is, as well as to multiline selections.
