RStudio provides "Push button deployment" to Posit Connect (formerly RStudio Connect), Shinyapps.io, Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud), and RPubs.com.

[Posit Connect](https://www.posit.co/products/connect/) supports a spectrum of data products, static or dynamic, developed in R and Python: Dashboards, applications, APIs, reports, and so much more. Connect enables flexible permissions configurations and meets all enterprise security requirements.


[Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)'s publishing features are currently a Beta Feature. The platform supports publishing of static content (Quarto and R Markdown), apps (Shiny for R and Python, Dash, Streamlit) and APIs (Plumber, Flask, FastAPI).

[Shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) supports hosting of Shiny for R and Python.

[RPubs.com](https://rpubs.com/) supports hosting of static content only such as R Markdown.

## Connecting Your Account

Install the [rsconnect](https://rstudio.github.io/rsconnect/) R package, which is required for publishing:

``` r
install.packages("rsconnect")
# or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/rsconnect")
```

You'll need to connect RStudio to the remote hosting environment (e.g. Posit Connect, Shinyapps.io, Posit Cloud) and authorize RStudio to use your account. To add a publishing account to RStudio, press **Tools** in the main menu, then **Global Options\...**.

In the Options panel that appears, choose **Publishing** in the sidebar, and use the **Connect\...** button to add a new account.

Log in and click **Connect** to authorize the IDE to deploy on your behalf. Then return to the IDE and click the **Connect Account** button.

Once you have successfully configured the connection within RStudio, you may now publish content to Posit Connect, Posit Cloud, or Shinyapps.io.
