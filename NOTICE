GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0
---------------------------------------------
GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
   exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
   computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
   public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
   to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
   feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
   tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
   extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
   work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
   the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
   menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
   is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
   Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
   Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
   implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
   "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
   (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
   (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
   produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
   the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
   work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
   control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
   System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
   programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
   which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
   includes interface definition files associated with source files for
   the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
   subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
   can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
   Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
   same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
   convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
   in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
   of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
   with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
   the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
   not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
   for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
   and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
   your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
   the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
   makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
   measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
   the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
   technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
   and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
   terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
      it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
      released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
      This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
      "keep intact all notices".

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
      work need not make them do so.

      A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
      works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
      and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
      in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
      "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
      used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
      beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
      in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
      parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
   of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
   machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
   in one of these ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
      customarily used for software interchange.

   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
      with subsection 6b.

   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
      charge under subsection 6d.

      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
      from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
      included in conveying the object code work.

      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
      tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
      or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
      into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
      doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
      product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
      typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
      of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
      actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
      is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
      commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
      the only significant mode of use of the product.

      "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
      procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
      and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
      a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
      suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
      code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
      modification has been made.

      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
      specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
      part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
      User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
      fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
      Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
      by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
      if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
      modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
      been installed in ROM).

      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
      requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
      for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
      the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
      network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
      adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
      protocols for communication across the network.

      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
      in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
      documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
      source code form), and must require no special password or key for
      unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
   that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
   this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
   remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
   it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
   removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
   additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
   for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
   add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
   that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
      Notices displayed by works containing it; or

   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
      those licensors and authors.

      All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
      restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
      received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
      governed by this License along with a term that is a further
      restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
      a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
      License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
      of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
      not survive such relicensing or conveying.

      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
      must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
      additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
      where to find the applicable terms.

      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
      form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
      the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
   provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
   paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
   license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
   provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
   holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
   prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
   reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
   violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
   received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
   your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
   this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
   material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
   run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
   to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
   nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
   modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
   not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
   covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
   propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
   work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
   transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
   licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
   give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
   Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
   the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
   rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
   not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
   rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
   sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
   work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
   owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
   hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
   by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
   but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
   consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
   purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
   patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
   this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
   propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
   sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
   party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
   patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
   and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
   to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
   publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
   then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
   patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
   consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
   license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
   actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
   covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
   in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
   country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
   arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
   covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
   receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
   or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
   you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
   work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
   the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
   conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
   specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
   work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
   in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
   to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
   the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
   parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
   patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
   conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
   for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
   contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
   or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
   any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
   otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
   the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
   Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
   interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
   supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
   Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
   from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
   means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
   shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
   of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
   following paragraph.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
   under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
   combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
   License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
   but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
   3 of the GNU General Public License.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
   Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
   Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
   option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
   version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
   GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
   by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
   versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
   public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
   to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different
   permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
   author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
   later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
   IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
   DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
   above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
   reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
   an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
   Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
   copy of the Program in return for a fee.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
   limited to, the following:

   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;

   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;

   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
      directive); and

   vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
   of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
   irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
   Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
   of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
   future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
   worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
   treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
   medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
   including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
   purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
   member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
   successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
   revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
   equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
   as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
   be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
   Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
   account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
   extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
   person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
   time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
   of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
   limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
   "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
   applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
   reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
   partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
   of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
   will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
   Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
   action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
   express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
      title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
      infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
      the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
      the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
      Work.

   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
      this CC0 or use of the Work.

GNU General Public License version 2.0
--------------------------------------
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
   a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
   refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
   means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
   language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
   the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
   running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
   is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
   Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
   Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
   notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
   and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
   along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
      on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
      collective works based on the Program.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
      with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
      the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
   under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,

   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
      code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
      associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
      control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
      special exception, the source code distributed need not include
      anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
      form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
      operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
      itself accompanies the executable.

      If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
      access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
      access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
      distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
      compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
   this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
   these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
   any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
   apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
   circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
   implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
   may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
   those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
   countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
   the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
   either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
   Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
   this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
   to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
   Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
   of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
   of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w`.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c` for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w` and `show c` should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w` and `show c`; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

GNU General Public License version 3.0
--------------------------------------
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.

    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
   exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
   computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
   public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
   to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
   feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
   tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
   extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
   work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
   the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
   menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
   is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
   Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
   Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
   implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
   "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
   (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
   (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
   produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
   the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
   work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
   control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
   System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
   programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
   which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
   includes interface definition files associated with source files for
   the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
   subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
   can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
   Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
   same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
   convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
   in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
   of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
   with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
   the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
   not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
   for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
   and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
   your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
   the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
   makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
   measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
   the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
   technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
   and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
   terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
      it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
      released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
      This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
      "keep intact all notices".

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
      work need not make them do so.

      A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
      works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
      and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
      in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
      "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
      used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
      beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
      in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
      parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
   of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
   machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
   in one of these ways:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
      customarily used for software interchange.

   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
      with subsection 6b.

   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
      charge under subsection 6d.

      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
      from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
      included in conveying the object code work.

      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
      tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
      or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
      into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
      doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
      product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
      typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
      of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
      actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
      is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
      commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
      the only significant mode of use of the product.

      "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
      procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
      and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
      a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
      suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
      code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
      modification has been made.

      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
      specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
      part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
      User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
      fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
      Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
      by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
      if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
      modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
      been installed in ROM).

      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
      requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
      for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
      the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
      network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
      adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
      protocols for communication across the network.

      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
      in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
      documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
      source code form), and must require no special password or key for
      unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
   that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
   this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
   remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
   it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
   removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
   additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
   for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
   add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
   that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
      Notices displayed by works containing it; or

   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
      those licensors and authors.

      All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
      restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
      received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
      governed by this License along with a term that is a further
      restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
      a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
      License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
      of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
      not survive such relicensing or conveying.

      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
      must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
      additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
      where to find the applicable terms.

      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
      form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
      the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
   provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
   paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
   license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
   provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
   holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
   prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
   reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
   violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
   received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
   your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
   this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
   material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
   run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
   to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
   nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
   modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
   not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
   covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
   propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
   work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
   transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
   licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
   give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
   Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
   the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
   rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
   not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
   rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
   sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
   work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
   owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
   hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
   by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
   but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
   consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
   purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
   patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
   this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
   propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
   sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
   party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
   patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
   and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
   to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
   publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
   then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
   patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
   consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
   license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
   actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
   covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
   in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
   country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
   arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
   covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
   receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
   or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
   you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
   work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
   the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
   conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
   specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
   work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
   in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
   to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
   the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
   parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
   patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
   conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
   for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
   contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
   or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
   any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
   otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
   the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
   under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
   combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
   License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
   but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
   section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
   combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
   Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
   Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
   option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
   version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
   GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
   by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
   versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
   public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
   to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different
   permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
   author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
   later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
   IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
   DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
   above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
   reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
   an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
   Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
   copy of the Program in return for a fee.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w`.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c` for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w` and `show c` should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0
---------------------------------------------
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
   General Public License.

   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
   by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
   Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
   of using an interface provided by the Library.

   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
   Version".

   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
      function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
      this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
   a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
   (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.

4. Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
   taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
   portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
   the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
      the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
      these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
      copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

      i) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
         suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
         recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
         the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
         manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
         Corresponding Source.

      ii) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
         Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
         a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
         system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
         of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
         Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
      be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
      GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
      necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
      Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
      Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
      you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
      the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
      Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
      Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
      for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side by side in a single library together with other library
   facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
   License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
   choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
      on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
      conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
      is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
   applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that published version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
   received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
   Library.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE

==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

```
    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
```

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
identification within third-party archives.

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public
permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
licensed material, or material used under an exception or
limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
the licensed material may still be restricted for other
reasons, including because others have copyright or other
rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 -- Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
   Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
   and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
   arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
   permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
   Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
   Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
   Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
   synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
   and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
   accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
   closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
   performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
   Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
   categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
   specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
   Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
   absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
   fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
   Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
   agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
   any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
   that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
   or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
   License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
   terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
   all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
   Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
   under this Public License.

   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
      available to the public including in ways that members of the
      public may access the material from a place and at a time
      individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
   resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
   the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
   as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
   equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
   under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

   Section 2 -- Scope.

a. License grant.

   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

      i. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
         in part; and

      ii. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
      its terms and conditions.

   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
      6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4)
      never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

      i. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
         recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
         receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
         Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
         Public License.

      ii. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
         any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
         apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
         Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
         Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
         Material.

   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
      Rights, but not otherwise.

   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
      Public License.

   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
      reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

a. Attribution.

   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
      form), You must:

a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
   with the Licensed Material:

   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
      Material and any others designated to receive
      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
      the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
      designated);

   ii. a copyright notice;

   iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

   iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
      warranties;

   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
      extent reasonably practicable;

b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
   retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
   Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
   hyperlink to, this Public License.

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
      information.

   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
      reasonably practicable.

   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
      License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
      Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
   to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
   portion of the contents of the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
   contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
   all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
   replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
   Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
   EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
   AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
   ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
   IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
   ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
   KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
   ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
   TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
   COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
   USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
   DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
   IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
   possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
   waiver of all liability.

   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
   Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
   this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
   terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
   Section 6(a), it reinstates:

   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
      violation; or

   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
   Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
   distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
   will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
   License.

   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
   terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
   Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
   independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

   Section 8 -- Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
   shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
   conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
   be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
   deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
   cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
   without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
   conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
   failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
   Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
   as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
   that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
   processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

   documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
   agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
   Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
   Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
   machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
   reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
   long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
   the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
   the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
   of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
   service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
   Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
   in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
   patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
   expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
   offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
   defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
   such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
   interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
   License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
   license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
   Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
   Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
   the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
   Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
   modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
   the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
   by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
   of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
   and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
   sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
   and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
   the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
   This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
   license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
   Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
   or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
   or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
   of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
   apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
   negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
   jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
   a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
   obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
   else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
   grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
   or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
   to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
   between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
   equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
   exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
   Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
   and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
   as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
   against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
   patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
   patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
   hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
   License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
   Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
   the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
   Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
   scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
   requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et
   seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
   section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
   seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
   recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
   attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
   any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
   License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
   the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
   make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
   in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
   under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
   entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
   under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i)
   the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
   entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
   (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
   entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
   restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
   to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

   This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.
   Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without
   modification. This license may not be modified without the express written
   permission of its copyright owner.

   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
     exercising permissions granted by this License.

     "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
     including but not limited to software source code, documentation
     source, and configuration files.

     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
     and conversions to other media types.

     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

  To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
  boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
  replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
  the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
  comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
  file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

    A large portion of the dictionary entries

    Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
    original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
    that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
    on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
    in the same form as set out herein and that such intended

    NO WARRANTY

    The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
    research and development conducted during the project and is provided
    to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
    program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
    implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
    includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
    performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
    the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
    any right of any third party.

    Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
    have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
    the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
    otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

    and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
    with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
    or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
    regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
    knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
    project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
    foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
    "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
    modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
    production of secondary products from the program.
  >
    In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
    modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
    any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
    grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
    writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
    from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
    above as far as the program is concerned.

  Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
  Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
  is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
  Database section 7.

  >
    7.  Database Ownership
  >
       The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
       document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
       that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
       public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
       not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
       to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
       Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
       Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
       understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
       with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
       by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
       making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
       future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.
  >
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and
  >
       d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.
  >
           You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
           the conditions stated in this License.
  >
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  >
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  >
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  >
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  >
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
     and conversions to other media types.

     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  The Artistic License 2.0

  Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  Preamble

  This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
  Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
  The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
  control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
  Package available as open source and free software.

  You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
  license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
  terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
  make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
  a different licensing arrangement.

  Definitions

  "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
  named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

  "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
  material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
  procedures.

  "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
  distribute, or modify the Package.

  "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the

  Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
  those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
  Version, or a Modified Version.

  "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
  accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
  organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

  "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
  this Package or providing support for this Package to another
  party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

  "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
  modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
  by the Copyright Holder.

  "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
  such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
  Holder.

  "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
  the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
  it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

  "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
  configuration files for the Package.

  "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
  or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
  translation of the Source form.

  Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

  1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
      Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
      you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

  Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

  2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
      Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
      either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
      all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
      your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
      Compiled form of the Package.

  3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
      modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
      Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
      will be subject to the Original License.

  Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

  4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
      or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
      Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
      from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
      any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
      you do at least ONE of the following:

      a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
          of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the

          Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
          Version.

      b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
          prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
          addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
          from the name of the Standard Version.

      c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
          make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
          under

          i)  the Original License or

          ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
              modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
              licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
              received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
              Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
              available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
              Fees are allowed.

  Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
  or Modified Versions without the Source

  5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
      the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
      get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
      valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
      time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
      must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
      If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
      days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
      you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

  6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
      the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
      the Source of the Modified Version.

  Aggregating or Linking the Package

  7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
      Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
      aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
      Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
      components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
      apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
      as included in the aggregation.

  8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
      other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
      build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
      include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
      provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

  Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

  9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
      merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
      the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
      considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
      terms of this license.

  General Provisions

  10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
       Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
       modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
       use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
       license.

  11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
       Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
       to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
       this license.

  12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
       service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

  13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
       free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
       sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
       patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
       infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
       (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
       that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
       infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
       date that such litigation is filed.

  14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:

       THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
       IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
       WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
       NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
       LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
       BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
       DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
       ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

      "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

      "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

      "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

      "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

      2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

   3. REQUIREMENTS

      A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

   i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

   ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

   iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

   iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

   Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

      Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

      For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   5. NO WARRANTY

      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. GENERAL

      If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

      If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

      All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

      This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

PCRE2 Licence

=============

| SPDX-License-Identifier: | BSD-3-Clause WITH PCRE2-exception |
|---------|-------|

PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory,
is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built. The just-in-time compiler is separately licensed under the
"2-clause BSD" licence.

EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
   other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
   this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
   which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
   Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
   and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
   running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
   such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
   on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
   writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
   and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
   warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
   fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
      root function must still compute square roots.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
      it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
      collective works based on the Library.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
      the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
   these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
   that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
   the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
   must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
   distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
   Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
   Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
   structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
   functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
   file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
   work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
   Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
   link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
   work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
   modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
   of these things:

   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
      to use the modified definitions.)

   b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

   c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
      least three years, to give the same user the materials
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
      than the cost of performing this distribution.

   d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.

   e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
      Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
      reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
      the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
      normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
      which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
      the executable.

      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
      restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
      accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
      use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
      distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
   permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
      Sections above.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
   the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
   or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is
   implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
   an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
   of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
   and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<signature of Moe Ghoul>, 1 April 1990
Moe Ghoul, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

FIXME: Cephes math lib

Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier

It sounds vague, but as to be found at

<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an
impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit
permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So
probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a
permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files
in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the
version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming
from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.
